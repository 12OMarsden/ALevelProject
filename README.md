# ALevelProject

My project provides a system to mark/referee a squash match in real time. It provides a platform to connect to a widely used squash match result recording database and allows authorised users to upload results to this database and see the outcome of the upload.

#Note: SquashLevels API has changed since finishing this project and so that functionality of the program no loger works.
